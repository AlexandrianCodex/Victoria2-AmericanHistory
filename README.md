# Victoria2-AmericanHistory
"American History" submod for the Victoria 2 mod "Historical Project Mod" HPM


To install: Extract the archive into your existing HPM directory, overwriting files as-needed.

Flags:
Do flags not look right, or have you crashed during "Loading Flags"?
Don't worry! This is not an unusual modded Victoria 2 issue, and is super easy to fix.
Go to C:\Users\[UserName]\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Victoria II\HPMTest\gfx\flags
The problem is, probably, that you don't have a file named "flagfiles_monarchy.tga". 
The solution?
Make a copy of flagfiles.tga and name it to flagfiles_monarchy.tga
That's it!
I have no idea why Victoria 2 doesn't finish creating the flag files sometimes, but this workaround fixes the issue!
